# Lab 4: Interactive Activation Networks

In this lab we will explore Interactive Activation Networks, like those described by Rumelhart & McClelland (CITE), in two different scenarios.

## Part 1: A model of the phenomenology of binocular rivalry.

Rob Goldstone used an interactive activation network to model the phenomenological experience of binocular rivalry. He released this on [a website](https://www.indiana.edu/~pcl/robsexperiments/tests&examples/binocularrivalry/binocularRivalryQ370.html) where you can explore the parameters of the model and experience the phenomenonology for yourself.

For part 1 of the lab, you'll generate a concise "lab report" of your efforts to work through the questions posed on the website. There are two sets of questions. The first set deals with your observations of your own experience while using the website. The second set asks you to manipulate the parameters of the model in various ways and compare the result to the data you gathered for answering the first set of questions. 

Work with at least one partner as you tackle this model. 

We'll use this lab report as an opportunity to learn Markdown. Markdown is a markup language (no programming here!), and it is what this readme file is generated in. The goal of Markdown is to create a text document that can be read in plain text format or can be rendered into a stylized document. If you view this file on GitHub, you are seeing the stylized version. But if you open it in RStudio, you'll see the plain text version.

Generate your lab report in the file `lab-report.md`. You don't need to stylize your lab report too much, but it might be useful to add an occasional image of what you showed the model or to create a numbered list. You might also want to use various section headers or even a link. You can find the appropriate Markdown syntax using [this cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). You can, as always, also just ask me for help as needed.

If you are in RStudio and want to see what the stylized version of your Markdown document looks like, you can click the "Preview" button at the top of the editor. This will create an `.html` output file and open it for you.

## Part 2: Creating an interactive activation network

For part 2, you'll create an interactive activation network to get some practice with the kinds of computation needed to create neural network models. Follow the instructions provided in `model.R`.
